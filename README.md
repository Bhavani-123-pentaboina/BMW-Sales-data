BMW Sales Data Project

Project Title : BMW Sales Data Analysis using Python
This project analyzes BMW car sales data using Python. It includes data cleaning, visualization, and insights into sales trends by region, year, fuel type, transmission, and model.

Dataset Information
columns: Year, Model, Region, Fuel Type, Transmission, Mileage, Sales Volume, Price.

------Features------
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Sales Trends over Time
Comparison by Region, Model, and Fuel Type

Visualizations Like Bar charts, line graphs, area charts, Box plot, Scatter Plot, Pie Chart, Horizontal Bar Graph.

-------Tech Stack--------
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly (if used)
Environment: Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

------Installation & Setup-------
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/bmw-sales-analysis.git  
# Navigate into folder
cd bmw-sales-analysis  
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt  

----- Usage------
Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts:
jupyter notebook bmw_sales_analysis.ipynb

------Example visualizations------
Line Graph → Sales Over Years
Bar Chart → Top 10 BMW Models
Area Chart → Regional Sales Trends

-----Insights-----
Affordable BMW models drive most sales.
Luxury cars maintain brand prestige but sell less.
Automatic cars are more popular than manual.
Hybrid/Electric sales are growing in premium segments.
Resale value depends on mileage & engine size.
